# e-Vegan

Development of a ecommerce for homemade local vegan food.

## Local setup

The current repository is ready to start working on it. The client folder has the react components and packages, and the server folder has everything setup to start except the DB connection. Packages installed already:

- Nodemon (package.json has the start script already to start with nodemon by default)
- Express
- PG
- Morgan
- Cors
- Concurrently

If we need another package don't hesitate to install it and add it to this list.
